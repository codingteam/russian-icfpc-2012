These three # signs marked the beginning of data segment as well as
first comment. Grep is your friend now.

RGB triplets in this file do not really store colors.

Each triplet of bytes correspoding to a pixel contains values A,B,C
(in this order), each a signed 8-bit integer.

Remember that BMP stores image upside-down, so first bytes of data
segment are first triplets of last row of image.

Let X=70 and Y=79 be coordinates of current pixel. Let VX=18 and VY=26
(signed 8-bit integers) be current vector. Let CLR=0.

Loop: take values A,B,C from triplet corresponding to current pixel in this BMP.

Xor VX with A, VY with B and CLR with C.

If CLR is not 0 draw a line from (X,Y) to (X+VX,Y+VY).

Add VX to X and VY to Y, repeat the loop until A=B=C=0.

So first visited points should be (70,79), (70,87), (64,79), (64,87)...
