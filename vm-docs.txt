	VVVM:
 A Very Von Neumann Virtual Machine

Its memory is an array of 13371111
words. Eash word is a 32 bit integer
little endian. VVVM has one register:
IP - instruction pointer.

 Data segment of this file must be
placed in the beginning of VVVM memory

There are 11 instructions in VVVM
Each takes 2-4 words:
instruction word followed by operands

Higher 16 bits of instruction word
denote one of 11 commands
Lower 16 bits contain a signed integer
Add it to IP to get to next instruction

Just one font is used here

Commands 1-8 are binary operations
OP: + - * / and or << >>
A[IP+A[IP+1]] = A[IP+A[IP+2]] OF A[IP+3]

9 means bitwise not:
A[IP+A[IP+1]] = NOT A[IP+2]

10 means if less:
IF A[IP+2] < A[IP+3] THEN IP += A[IP+1]

Command 11 prints A[IP+1] as char

VVVM starts with IP=32
